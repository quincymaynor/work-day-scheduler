# work-day-scheduler

It works in conjuntion with Day.js to display the date and time and selectively apply CSS styles in order to indicate which schedule items should be addressed at the given hour. This project also served as practice for coding with third-party APIs including jQuery, Bootstrap, and Day.js.
